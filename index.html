          <p>
            I’m a 24 years old male who graduated from college with a bachelor
            degree in computer engineering. Born and raised in Egypt. I started
            learning game development right away after I graduated as that was
            my dream job From the beginning. Because it was not as popular as
            other industries in Egypt, there was no Game Development college,
            but I took some courses and self-studied to improve myself at Unity
            and am still learning.

                This is my first multiplayer game with PUN 2 in unity . It’s a
                multiplayer/shooter fun game using rigid bodies. I also used
                blender in this project and made the main model the stickman
                myself including its bones and animations and also used the
                unity animation rigging feature. For a deep dive on the game and
                how I made it check this blog

                In this project I used Character Controller and wanted to test
                and learn the lightning in unity and how can u make a horror
                atmosphere . I Also used navmesh and Ai for the zombies and
                monsters in the game and learned the clean code way for having
                multiple weapons on the main character.

              <p>
                This is one of the games I learned to make while taking a course
                but I wanted to innovate on it and changed it a lot that you
                cant say its the same game anymore. Also learned new things
                about Particle Collisions and particle unity system and how to
                make them pretty.

              <p>
                This was my first game ever to make in unity. As simple as it
                was I was proud of how smooth it was and enlightened my joy for
                game creation even more.

                As a fan of bloons TD and similar game I had to try and make one
                and see how it works. I already knew about the algorithms for
                pathfinding since college like A* but never knew how it would
                work in games so this game was learning experience for that .
